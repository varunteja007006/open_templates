## DOCKER üê≥

If you have docker installed it is quite simple to spin up this project on the docker.
All the instructions below are for the linux operating system.

First create the docker images

```sh
docker compose build
```

Second deploy the containers

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

To check the status of the containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

To stop the containers:

```sh
docker compose down
```

To remove the containers:

```sh
docker compose rm
```

To remove all the containers, images, and volumes: (`Careful, do it only if you have no other containers, image, volumes`)

```sh
docker compose system prune -a
```

To run the shell in the container:

```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```

To exit the shell:

```sh
exit
```

Going into the docker shell can help create super admin

```sh
docker exec -it container_id python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Also if you want to use google auth, you can create a google application and create an api client.

STEP 1: Login into the admin panel, Go to applications under Django OAuth Toolkit, and create a new application.

STEP 2: Associate the application with the super admin.

STEP 3:

- Client Type - Public
- Authorization Grant Type - Client Credentials
- Name - Give this Application some name

STEP 3: Uncheck the Hash Client Secret. `Very important, because it is a bug`

   things from the backend as well)
